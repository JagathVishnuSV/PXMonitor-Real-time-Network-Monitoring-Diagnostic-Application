Here's the twist 
there are three models 
anomaly_model trained on
Isolation forest
FEATURE_COLUMNS = ['latency', 'jitter', 'bandwidth', 'packet_loss', 'dns_delay']
where it provides the data as the anomaly or not in -1 and in 1 for not anamoly
however I need to convert this anomaly into something like 
If in case of anamoly and that time when there is high latency (Rule based approaches) , it gives some message that is understandable by layman
or if it is anomaly and jitter means , it give some other reponse 



for the gradient boosting model it is trained on 
FEATURES = ['latency', 'jitter', 'packet_loss', 'bandwidth']
and provides the result as the 
Target Encoding Map: {0: '1080p', 1: '480p', 2: '720p'}
The target value needs to be typecast to it

and for the next model
Bottleneck model
congestion_mapping = {'High': 2, 'Moderate': 1, 'Low': 0}
features = ['latency', 'jitter', 'bandwidth', 'packet_loss', 'dns_delay', 'congestion_level_encoded']

congestion model is encoded to number and then the it is sended and it's output is a string 




I need to enhance this prompt like 
by adding create a new page with existing with the title 
"Seraphims, your helpful machine learning models"
"and two line description about like check out our models to know about the things"
and then create a three separated divs that has the heading 
Description
and button that eventually calls that models
